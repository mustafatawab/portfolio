GitHub hosts your Git remotes and adds collaboration: Pull Requests, Issues, protections, and CI triggers. This guide connects local Git to real team workflows.

If you already know how to commit locally (see [Git Basics](/blogs/git-basics)), this is the next layer — getting that history onto GitHub and working with a team.

## What GitHub Adds

Git alone = history on one machine (or bare remotes).

GitHub adds:

| Feature           | Purpose                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Remote hosting    | Backup + single source of truth      |
| Pull Requests     | Propose + review merges              |
| Issues            | Track bugs/tasks                     |
| Actions           | CI/CD pipelines                      |
| Permissions       | Who can push / merge                 |
| Releases / Tags UI | Version your software               |

```
You (git commit / push)
        ↓
    GitHub repo
        ↓
  PR → Review → Merge to main
        ↓
  GitHub Actions (build/test/deploy)
```

## Authentication (HTTPS vs SSH)

### HTTPS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

Uses a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** instead of your account password when Git asks for a password.

### SSH (recommended for daily work)

1. Generate a key (if you don't have one):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com"
```

2. Start agent & add key:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

3. Copy public key → GitHub → **Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key**

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

4. Test:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

5. Clone with SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:user/repo.git
```

Optional `~/.ssh/config` (same idea as SSH hosts on a Linux server):

```
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

## Create a Repo & First Push

### On GitHub

1. **New repository**
2. Name it, choose Public/Private
3. Don't add a README if you already have a local project (avoids a merge conflict on first push) — or do add it if you're starting empty on GitHub only

### From an existing local project

```bash
cd my-app
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:USER/REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

**`-u`** sets upstream so later you can just run `git push` / `git pull`.

### Empty GitHub repo → clone then work

```bash
git clone git@github.com:USER/REPO.git
cd REPO
# add files, commit, push
```

---

## Remotes Explained

A **remote** is a nickname for a URL of another repo copy.

```bash
git remote -v
```

Typical output:

```
origin  git@github.com:USER/REPO.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:USER/REPO.git (push)
```

| Term         | Meaning                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **origin**   | Default name for "the" GitHub remote                         |
| **upstream** | Often used in forks = original project you forked from       |

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:USER/REPO.git
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USER/NEW.git
git remote remove origin
```

---

## Fetch, Pull, Push

**`git fetch`** — Download new commits from remote **without** changing your files. Safe preview.

```bash
git fetch origin
git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline    # what's new on remote?
```

**`git pull`** — `fetch` + integrate into your current branch (merge or rebase, depending on config).

```bash
git pull
git pull origin main
```

**`git push`** — Upload your commits to the remote.

```bash
git push
git push -u origin feature-login    # first push of a new branch
```

### Rejected push?

```
! [rejected] non-fast-forward
```

Someone else pushed first. Fix:

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main    # or git pull
# resolve conflicts if any
git push
```

Don't force-push to shared `main`.

## Clone vs Fork

|        | Clone                            | Fork                                                      |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| What   | Copy repo to your machine        | Copy repo to **your GitHub account**                      |
| When   | You have access / own it         | Contributing to someone else's project                    |
| Remote | `origin` → that repo             | `origin` → your fork; often add `upstream` → original     |

Fork workflow:

```bash
# after forking on GitHub website
git clone git@github.com:YOU/project.git
cd project
git remote add upstream git@github.com:ORIGINAL/project.git

git fetch upstream
git switch main
git merge upstream/main          # or rebase
```

Open a PR from **your fork's branch** → **original repo's main**.

---

## Pull Requests (PRs)

A **Pull Request** asks: "Please review my branch and merge it into `main` (or another branch)."

### Typical flow

```bash
git switch main
git pull
git switch -c feature/add-healthcheck
# commit work
git push -u origin feature/add-healthcheck
```

On GitHub: **Compare & pull request**

Write:

- **Title** — clear, like a good commit message
- **Description** — what / why / how to test
- Link Issues if any (`Fixes #12`)

### Merge options on GitHub

| Option               | Result                                          |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Merge commit**     | Keeps all commits + a merge commit              |
| **Squash and merge** | One commit on `main` (clean history)            |
| **Rebase and merge** | Linear commits without merge commit             |

Many teams prefer **squash** for feature branches.

After merge:

```bash
git switch main
git pull
git branch -d feature/add-healthcheck
git push origin --delete feature/add-healthcheck   # if not auto-deleted
```

## Code Review Basics

As author:

- Keep PRs small and focused
- Self-review the diff before requesting review
- Respond to comments; push fixes to the **same branch**

As reviewer:

- Check correctness, security (secrets?), and ops impact
- Prefer questions and suggestions over vague "fix this"
- Approve when ready to merge

DevOps-minded review questions:

- Will this break the pipeline?
- Are secrets in the diff?
- Dockerfile / compose / k8s changes intentional?
- Rollback plan if deploy fails?

---

## Branch Protection

On GitHub: **Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules** (for `main`):

Common rules:

- Require Pull Request before merge
- Require approvals
- Require status checks (CI must pass)
- Restrict who can push
- Do not allow force push
- Do not allow deletion

This protects production history and enforces CI before anything lands on `main`.

---

## Issues (Light)

**Issues** track bugs, tasks, and ideas.

Useful habits:

- One issue = one problem
- Labels: `bug`, `enhancement`, `docs`
- Close via PR description: `Fixes #42` / `Closes #42`

You don't need full project boards to be effective — Issues + PRs are enough to start.

---

## GitHub & CI/CD

GitHub Actions usually starts from Git events:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

So:

- Push to a branch → CI can build/test
- Open/update a PR → checks run before merge
- Merge to `main` → CD can deploy

Deep pipelines are covered in [GitHub Actions From Zero](/blogs/github-actions-from-zero) and [Docker + GitHub Actions](/blogs/docker-github-actions-deploy). Here, remember: **clean branches + PRs are the front door to automation**.

Also never commit:

- `.env`, cloud keys, kubeconfigs, private SSH keys

Use GitHub **Secrets** for CI credentials.
